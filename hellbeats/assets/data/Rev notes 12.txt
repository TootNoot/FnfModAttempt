If I was you.. I would read the other notes FIRST!




So I released hellbeats!  I basically got mixed reactions from the fnf community(Even Kade dev himself)
But I didn't care If it didn't sync...
When I started to get more hate when I released week 4... I lost movitation and started to work on something else...  and that something else was a low quality kirby mod...

A fellow modder named AX901 added me in discord...  he said my hellbeats mod was his inspirtion to the Negative A mod...  which I thought was cool...
AX901 gave me movitation by telling me different patterns If could go for rather than spam (and also because he wanted to do a collab)(when is the collab?)(We're not telling you!)
So I made week 5 and week 6... pretty pog right?

I'm hopeing I will do remixes in the future... not right now tho because I don't know how to remix or create songs and I don't have someone that will help me remix the songs...
I hope you all understand that...
